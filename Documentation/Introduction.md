# Introduction to the Steiner Triple Systems Project
## Overview
This project focuses on the generation and analysis of Steiner Triple Systems (STS). Steiner Triple Systems are collections of triples (sets of three elements, sometimes called blocks) such that every pair of elements appears in exactly one triple. This project aims to explore various algorithms and methods to construct these systems and analyze their properties, particularly their graphical representations.

## Purpose
The main objective of this research project is to find Steiner Triple Systems with minimal circumference. We analyzed systems primarily of order 25; while smaller systems have been studied more, a larger-order system like 25 has room to explore.

## Key Features
- **Generation of Steiner Triple Systems**: Using the revised Stinson's algorithm to efficiently generate valid STS based on specific orders.
- **Cycle Analysis**: Analyzing the graph representation of an STS to find the longest simple cycle (circumference), providind insights into the structure and properties of the system.
- **Pasch Trades**: Implementing Pasch trades to explore different configurations of STS, ideally facilitating the discovery of systems with smaller circumferences.
- **Continuous Generation**: Offering functionality for the continuous generation of STS of a given order, allowing an exploration and documentation of a variety of systems.
